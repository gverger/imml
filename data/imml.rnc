## Here, one can customize imml schema.  
## Typical uses are upgrading versions without modifying current kit version 
## or creating a special schema that validates only offers for one publisher, 
## with fixed supplier-id or fixed publisher-id.

#default namespace = "http://ns.immateriel.fr/imml"
include "imml_kit.rnc"
imml.book.schema.version |= "2.0"
imml.order.schema.version |= "0.0"
